With review questions that change as you progress and are written in a way that build upon previously studied grammar, you are presented with a new and unique context in every study session. This means that, as you advance through your studies, you get more and more exposure to the grammar that you have learned. Bunpro uses an intuitive spaced repetition system (SRS) that adjusts each review session to maximize the speed at which you learn. Bunpro even recognizes when your answer was close or similar to the correct answer and guides you in the right direction. By taking the opportunity to explain alternate answers rather than simply marking you incorrect, Bunpro helps you grasp subtle nuances and encourages you to keep learning.\n\nBunpro quizzes you in unique contexts with a SRS system that promotes the reproduction of Japanese grammar."

        "content": "When it comes to studying Japanese, there is an almost infinite amount of information out there. From grammar sites like Imabi and Tae Kim to great textbook resources like Genki, Tobira, and Minna no Nihongo. However, there is no unified path to study. Every resource has its own grammar study order and often times you will find yourself studying N3 or N4 grammar before you are done with N5. While there is nothing wrong with this approach, you often end up finding a lack of continuity across multiple grammar resources.\n\nWith Bunpro, our aim is to give you a concise roadmap of what you need to learn here and now, consolidate multiple resources into one place, and reinforce what you learn as you progress to get the most out of your Japanese studies."
